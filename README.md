NRB Law-Grounded AI Language

A deterministic Law-Grounded Language Brain implementing the NRB Cognitive Stack:

Σ (Symbol/Signal) → ΔC (Grounding) → ΔP (Phenomenon) → Σ_out (Law-Constrained Output)

Core Principles:

- Deterministic Grounding (ΔC)
- Gene-based Memory (NRB-256)
- Law-Constrained Generation (GSRA/CPL)
- Audit-ready, replayable runtime
- No embedding-based probabilistic inference

Architecture Alignment:
COP / NRB / GSRA / PFT Stack
